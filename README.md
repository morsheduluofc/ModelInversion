# ModelInversion
This Repository has the code of our model inverstion project.
We have implemented and evaluated our proposed
approach on two existing BA systems: Touchalytics
(Frank et al., 2013b), and extended version of DAC,
eDAC (Islam et al., 2021). Touchalytics uses usersâ€™
touch data (up-down and left-right scrolling) when in-
teracting with the profile generator. We downloaded
Touchalytics data from (Frank et al., 2013a) and it has
the data from 41 distinct users. eDAC uses behav-
ioral features of users that are collected while drawing
random challenge circles that are presented to them
to verify their verification request. We downloaded
eDAC data from (Islam and Safavi-Naini, 2021) that
has the data of 195 distinct users
